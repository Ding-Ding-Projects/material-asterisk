/**
 * The product's own destination route: `ding-pbx://destination/<id>?<capture tuple>`.
 *
 * The design-parity evidence has always mapped each of the thirty-two audited destinations
 * to three things: a reference route into the design harness, a product route into this
 * application, and a built capture. Two of those three were real. The product route was a
 * committed string that nothing in `app/` resolved: no protocol was registered, no argument
 * was read, and no navigation would have happened if one had arrived. A route nobody can
 * follow is not a mapping, it is a plan for one, and it read as the former in every file
 * that carried it.
 *
 * This module is the one place the route is spelled, parsed and refused, so the string the
 * evidence records and the string the application accepts cannot drift apart. It is
 * deliberately free of Electron, of the DOM and of the destination catalogue: the main
 * process needs to decide "is this argument even a route" long before the renderer's
 * compiled catalogue is loaded, and the renderer needs to decide "is that a destination I
 * have" against the catalogue itself. Those are two questions, so they are two functions.
 *
 * What the application does with a route it accepts is narrower than what the route can
 * say, and that is a decision rather than an oversight; see `DESTINATION_ROUTE_APPLIES`.

 * their theme would be a link that edited their settings, and the person who clicked it
 * asked to go to a screen. The other four are still parsed and still validated, so a
