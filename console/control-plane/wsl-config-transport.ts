 *    interpolated from a caller, so there is no traversal to defend against — a name
 *    that is not on the list is refused before any command is built.
 *  - **Every command is an allowlisted executable with separate arguments.** No shell,
 *    no concatenated command string, no redirection. Content reaches the target through
 *    the process's standard input rather than through an argument, which keeps it out of
 *    the command line entirely.

   *    through renderConfig() would silently rewrite it to garbage.
   *  - dbsep.conf, res_config_mysql.conf, cdr_tds.conf, cel_tds.conf: each file's whole
   *    purpose is a database login (dbuser/dbpass, or TDS username/password) — there is
   *    no non-credential content left over once those fields are stripped, so exposing
   *    the file at all is exposing a credential field. res_odbc.conf, res_curl.conf and
   *    res_config_odbc.conf stay in because their credential-shaped fields (userpwd,
   *    ssl_keypasswd) are optional extras beside substantial non-secret configuration,
   *    the same balance the IAX2 model already strikes by typing every iax.conf peer
   *    field except `secret`.
   *  - ast_debug_tools.conf: read by companion shell scripts under contrib/, not by
   *    Asterisk itself, and uses '#' comments this parser does not recognise.
   *  - config_test.conf, test_sorcery.conf: fixtures for Asterisk's own C unit tests
   *    (test_config.c, test_sorcery.c); nothing running Asterisk ever loads them.
   *  - app_skel.conf: the sample config for app_skel.c, a documentation skeleton for
   *    module authors, not a real dialplan application.
   *  - chan_mobile.conf, ooh323.conf: sample files with no corresponding module in this
   *    source tree (chan_mobile.c and chan_ooh323 do not exist here), so nothing would
   *    ever read a file placed at either path.
   *  - console.conf: configures chan_console, a local sound-card channel driver. The WSL
   *    target this transport writes to has no local audio hardware, so this control
   *    could never do anything for it.

 * Renders a desired value over the file it came from, keeping every line the change did

 * comments. On this project's own sample dialplan that meant a single edit rewrote 880
 * lines and deleted 606 of them -- every comment explaining what the dialplan does. The
 * settings survived and the reasons for them did not, which is a worse outcome than a
 * failed write, because a failed write tells you.
 *
 * So the original text is walked line by line. A line that is not an entry -- a comment, a
 * blank, a section header -- is kept exactly as written. An entry whose key, value and
 * separator are unchanged is kept as its original line. An entry whose value changed is
 * re-rendered. An entry that is gone is dropped, and anything genuinely new is appended to
 * its section.
 *
 * Repeated keys are matched by position within the key, not by name alone, because these
 * files legitimately repeat one -- several `allow=` lines, many `exten =>` lines -- and
 * matching by name alone would collapse them into the first.
 *
 * Repeated *section names* are matched the same way, occurrence by occurrence, for the same
 * reason and against a worse failure. Keying the desired value by section name alone kept
 * only the last section of each name, so the shape nearly every real `pjsip.conf` uses --
 * `[6001] type=endpoint` followed by `[6001] type=aor` -- could not be written at all. An
 * *unchanged* round trip of it rendered `type = endpoint` as `type = aor`, deleted `context`
 * and `allow`, and moved `max_contacts` into the first section; parsed entry counts went
 * from `[3, 2]` to `[2, 2]`. It failed safe, because the transaction's post-read found the
 * result unequal to the desired value and rolled the write back -- so the cost was not a
 * damaged file but a resource this console could never write, and an operator told
 * `Post-read mismatch`, which names nothing about repeated sections. Measured against a live
 * Asterisk; `docs/evidence/live-readings.md`.
 *
 * Occurrence matching is positional, and that is a real limitation rather than a complete
 * answer: a section carries no identity beyond its name and where it sits, so deleting the
 * *first* `[6001]` and keeping the second is indistinguishable from editing the first into
 * the second. The surviving section is rendered over the first block's text, which keeps that
 * block's comments rather than the second's. The configuration written is correct; which
 * comments travel with it is decided by position, exactly as it already is for a repeated

  /**
   * An allowlisted file's exact text, unparsed.
   *
   * `read()` above answers nearly every caller, and the two are not interchangeable:
   * `parseConfig` keeps only `[section]` headers that end the line and `key = value`
   * pairs, so it silently drops `#include` directives, template markers and a header with
   * a trailing comment. A caller that has to reason about what Asterisk's own config
   * parser would make of the file — `parseExtensionsConfSections` is the one — needs the
   * bytes rather than that summary.
   *
   * This inherits `#readExact`'s deliberate non-redaction, so the text can carry a
   * credential and must not be logged, returned across the control-plane boundary, or put
   * on a screen. Every caller here derives facts from it and returns those instead.
   *
   * A file that is not there throws with the target's own reason rather than answering
   * with an empty string, because "the file is empty" and "there is no file" are different
   * facts and this console's whole discipline is not to conflate them.
