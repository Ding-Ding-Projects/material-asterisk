/**
 * The independently audited design carries 267 declarative bindings — 265 plus the two
 * added for the `file` control kind's own picker. The generated PBX editable-text M3
 * extension adds one real input with both onChange and onInput. The three frameless
 * window controls remain the only runtime window bindings outside that source material.
 * The `docs` destination (offline documentation browser) adds 6 onClick bindings
 * (search field regex toggle, regex palette tokens, per-result select, per-block link
 * spans in both paragraph and list-item form, suggested-article select) and 1 onChange
 * binding (the search field itself).
 * The accessibility pass adds 7 onKeyDown bindings, none of them wrapped in `fn(...)`
 * -- `onKeyDown` is not in the compiler's EVENTS set (scripts/compile-design.mjs), so
 * it is emitted as a raw prop and counted separately below rather than by the `fn(`
 * regex, which would silently report zero for every one of them. They are: the tab
 * strip's tablist wrapper (arrow/Home/End roving focus across the open-tab role="tab"
 * destinations); the tab-group header's role="button" toggle (Enter/Space activation,
 * since it is a div rather than a native button); the version-history commit-row
 * role="button" (Enter/Space activation); the docs-browser search-result row and
 * suggested-article row role="button"s (Enter/Space activation); and the docs article's
 * inline link span in both its paragraph and list-item rendering (Enter/Space
 * activation) -- each of those five reuses the same `activateOnEnter` helper in
 * App.tsx rather than a bespoke handler.
 * The tab-search extension adds eight reachable clicks: three discovery triggers, the
 * dismiss surface, scope selection, regex toggle, regex-builder launch, and result
 * activation. Its filter adds one change/input pair. Those fixed contributions are
 * enumerated below so the expected census remains hand-written rather than inferred.
