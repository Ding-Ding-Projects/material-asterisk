 * School mode, consumed.
 *
 * `tests/ui/school-mode.test.tsx` already proves the module DECIDES correctly. It always
 * did -- and for as long as it did, turning School mode on changed one status line and
 * nothing else, because the four functions the mode is named for had no caller outside
 * that test file. Every assertion there passed the whole time. So this file deliberately
 * asserts nothing about the decision and everything about the consumption.
 *
 * The load-bearing half runs the REAL `App` -- the product renderer, not the bare
 * compiled shell and not an injected stub -- with School mode genuinely on in its own
 * durable storage, and reads the markup back. That is the one thing a unit test cannot
 * fake its way past: a control that is still in the output is still on screen, whatever
 * any filter claims about it.
 *
 * The other half checks the filters against the REAL compiled design rather than against
 * fixtures invented here. A filter aimed at a control id the design does not have is a
 * filter that hides nothing, and it looks identical from inside a fixture.
