/**
 * Contract: the product route the design-parity evidence records is a route the product
 * actually resolves.
 *
 * Every one of the thirty-two audited destinations has carried a `ding-pbx://destination/<id>`
 * string in the parity evidence since that evidence was written. Nothing resolved it: no
 * scheme was registered, no argument was read, and the inventory's own `builtRouteStatus`
 * said so in a sentence nobody had to read to use the file. That is a mapping to nothing,
 * and it is the exact shape this project keeps being bitten by -- wired at one end and
 * consumed at neither.
 *
 * So the tests below are in two halves, and the second is the one that matters. The first
 * exercises the parser on its own. The second takes the strings that are ACTUALLY COMMITTED
 * in the inventory and in the capture manifest, hands each to the parser the running
 * application uses, and requires it to come back naming that row's own destination. A
 * template that stopped agreeing with the parser, or a row pointing at somebody else's
 * screen, fails here rather than in a screenshot nobody takes.
