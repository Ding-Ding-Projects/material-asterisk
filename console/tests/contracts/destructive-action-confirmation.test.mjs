/**
 * Contract: destructive-action super confirmation (the four-gate ceremony).
 *
 * This is a genuinely wired feature, and it is wired in a way worth checking carefully
 * because the compiled design ITSELF still contains the old, fake implementation. The
 * generated template defines its own `executeCeremony` that only clears the mole-game
 * timer, closes the dialog, and toasts "<command> executed and attested" -- without ever
 * running anything. `App.tsx` overrides `renderVals()`, calls `super.renderVals()`, and
 * then sets a real `executeCeremony` afterwards in the same object literal, which JS
 * object-spread ordering means wins. This file proves that override actually happens and
 * actually reaches the button the design renders, rather than trusting that a later
 * property in a long object literal really does shadow an earlier one.
