/**
 * Deliberate red-then-green proof for site/tests/contracts/local-file-converter.test.mjs.
 *
 * This contract exists because of a defect that had already shipped and that nothing
 * caught for what it was: `site/converter.html` carried a complete converter surface --
 * a file picker, an adapter catalogue, a target select, a queue, a pager, a cancel
 * button -- and not one of those control ids was mentioned anywhere in `site/app.js`,
 * the only script the page loads. Every control was inert, and the page looked finished.
 *
 * A converter is unusually good at hiding that. Nothing throws, nothing logs, the
 * catalogue is right there on screen, and the only symptom is that pressing a button
 * does nothing at all -- which reads as a slow page rather than as a page that was never
 * wired. So the contract runs the real extracted engine against real bytes and pins the
 * wiring by whole lines, and this file is what says it would actually notice if either
 * half stopped.
 *
 * One break at a time, always. Breaking three things and watching five assertions fail
 * proves only that something among them is watched.
 *
 * Every break edits a real file on disk, because that is the only way to exercise a test
 * that reads its subject off the filesystem. Two properties keep that safe:
 *
 *   - the original bytes are restored in a `finally`, and the restore is verified rather
 *     than assumed, so an interrupted run cannot leave a planted break behind;
 *   - a break whose replacement did not change the bytes is reported as a FAILED CASE
 *     rather than counted as a pass. An edit that never landed reads exactly like a
 *     guard that held, and an anchor written with `\n` against a CRLF file is the
 *     commonest way to fake a green.
 *
 * Usage:  node scripts/negative-local-file-converter-site.mjs
