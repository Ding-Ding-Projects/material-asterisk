 * The changelog the published site ships.
 *
 * The single source is `console/scripts/bundle-changelog.mjs`, which builds Markdown
 * from this repository's own tags: every version is a real tag, every change line is a
 * real commit reachable from that tag and not from the one before it, and every id is
 * the real 40-character SHA. This build reads the file that generator produced rather
 * than talking to git a second time, so the site and the desktop console cannot come to
 * carry two different changelogs from two different moments.
 *
 * Then it does the one thing the canonical contract asks for beyond shipping the text:
 * it refuses to emit a dead commit link. Every referenced id is handed to a single
 * `git cat-file --batch-check` and must resolve to a real commit object in this
 * repository.
 *
 * Whenever it cannot establish that -- no git on the machine, or a clone that simply
 * never fetched the objects -- the changelog still ships and the REPOSITORY URL is
 * dropped, so every id renders as plain text with no link on it. That is deliberately
 * not a thrown error: the promise is "never a dead link", and emitting no link keeps it
 * exactly, while failing the build would take the whole Pages deploy down for a reason
 * that has nothing to do with the pages.
 *
 * `changelogVerificationVerdict` below is where the one genuinely subtle judgement
 * lives -- what a "missing" report is and is not evidence of -- and it has its own tests
 * because the first version of it got that wrong and broke a deploy.

/**
 * What a "missing" report from `git cat-file` actually licenses us to conclude.
 *
 * This is a pure function with its own tests because getting it wrong shipped a broken
 * Pages deploy. The first version reasoned: git answered, git said missing, therefore the
 * commit is gone and the link would be dead, therefore throw. That is false in exactly the
 * case CI runs in. `actions/checkout` clones one commit deep, so `cat-file` correctly
 * reports every one of the twenty-six referenced commits as missing -- from THIS CHECKOUT.
 * It says nothing whatever about the repository, which still has all of them.
 *
 * The distinction the check actually needs is between "the repository has lost this
 * commit" and "this clone never fetched it", and `cat-file` alone cannot tell them apart.
 * `git rev-parse --is-shallow-repository` can, so it is what decides:
 *
 *   - nothing missing            -> verified; emit the links
 *   - missing, clone is shallow  -> unverifiable; emit the history with no links, say why
 *   - missing, clone is complete -> dead; fail the build, because now it really is a claim
 *                                   about the repository rather than about this directory
 *   - missing, depth unknown     -> unverifiable, because an unknown is not a proof
