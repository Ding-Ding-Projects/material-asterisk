# Deploy a server

## Behavior

This screen discovers local targets, verifies the selected target through the control plane, and keeps the configured server list in the installation's local inventory. Discovery alone is not treated as a connection: the desktop calls `server.connect`, starts the managed daemon when needed, and retries the verification once. The rail badge is empty until a real server row exists. It lives on the App rail, under the Deploy & application group: stand up a new server, then appearance, updates and the console itself.

## Configuration

### Repeating the deployment wizard

The wizard keeps an existing `onboard-menu` unchanged, even when it is empty or contains custom routes. The confirmation summary explains that creating a replacement menu was skipped. New endpoints can still be added; edit their routes explicitly in Configure > Dialplan.

The wizard prepares a plan only from verified configuration readings. A read failure or malformed response is reported instead of being treated as an empty file. Explicitly absent files remain valid for first deployment. The configuration planner checks the supplied original structured values against the current reading, and the transaction checks every changed resource in the plan again before taking backups or writing. Changed or unreadable resources require a fresh plan. A later staging read error also stops the write instead of rebuilding from empty text; only a missing original file permits first-file creation. This preflight does not lock out independent writers after the check.

After a successful apply, Local history receives a receipt containing the target identifier, resource names, and new extension identifiers. It contains no credentials or configuration contents. A failed history write is reported without describing the completed target write as undone. Restore target configuration from Configuration backups; restoring a local receipt does not restore the PBX.

New extension credentials appear once in a dismissible dialog. They are excluded from notification history and automatic narration, and the dialog clears them when closed. Save them securely before dismissing it. Changing the selected target before accepting the plan requires a new review.

### Route

How this console reaches Asterisk. Everything below reshapes itself around this answer. The selected local target is read from the real discovery result rather than from the design's example names.

- **Connection type** (`sv_kind`) — a segmented control, default `Local`, choices `Local`, `Local Docker`, `SSH`, `SSH Docker`. Local is the same machine. Local Docker is a container here. SSH is another machine. SSH Docker is a container on another machine, reached over SSH and then into the container.
  - *What it is:* How this console reaches Asterisk: locally, into a container, over SSH, or over SSH and then into a container.
  - *Why it exists:* Everything else on the screen reshapes around this answer, including how configuration files are written.
  - *Choosing a value:* Local for the same machine, Local Docker for a container here, SSH for another machine, SSH Docker for a container elsewhere.
  - *Gotcha:* Over SSH the manager port is forwarded through the tunnel, so it never crosses the network unprotected — but only if tunnel forwarding stays enabled.
- **Host** (`sv_host`) — the host value supplied to the local inventory. It starts empty until the user supplies a target.
- **Container** (`sv_container`) — the container context supplied to the local inventory when a container route is selected.
- **SSH user** (`sv_user`) — the user supplied to the local inventory for an SSH route.
- **SSH port** (`sv_sshport`) — a stepper control, default `22`.
- **Strict host key checking** (`sv_hostkey`) — a switch control, default `true`. On means a changed host key aborts the connection instead of asking you to accept it. That prompt is how people get compromised.
  - *What it is:* Whether a changed SSH host key aborts the connection.
  - *Why it exists:* A changed host key means either a rebuild or an interception. Only one of those is benign.
  - *Choosing a value:* On, always.
  - *Gotcha:* The prompt asking a human to accept a new key is precisely how these attacks succeed. This console refuses instead of asking.

### Manager interface

AMI for live events and CLI, ARI for Stasis applications.

- **Interface** (`sv_iface`) — a segmented control, default `AMI`, choices `AMI`, `ARI`, `Both`.
- **Manager port** (`sv_amiport`) — a stepper control, default `5038`.
- **TLS** (`sv_tls`) — a switch control, default `true`.
- **Forward through the SSH tunnel** (`sv_forward`) — a switch control, default `true`.
- **Reconnect automatically** (`sv_watch`) — a switch control, default `true`.
- **Open read-only** (`sv_readonly`) — a switch control, default `false`.

## Failure modes and security

The server list is an honest local inventory. A discovered target is not labelled connected until `server.connect` confirms it. If the control plane cannot answer, the row retains the exact unavailable reason and the dashboard retries failed readings on its one-second refresh cadence. Over SSH the manager port is forwarded through the tunnel, so it never crosses the network unprotected — but only if tunnel forwarding stays enabled. The prompt asking a human to accept a new key is precisely how these attacks succeed. This console refuses instead of asking.

- The dashboard reports `asterisk: command not found` on a machine that has the managed distribution → discovery is connecting to a different distribution. The console prefers `ding-pbx-console` whenever `wsl --list` includes it; if it still connects elsewhere, the runtime status did not report the managed name.
- The wizard says the runtime cannot be created and mentions a missing base image → the packaged runtime provenance was rejected. The control plane accepts the schema version the generator writes (currently 2); a mismatch reports the whole payload as unavailable.
- Asterisk starts and immediately dies with `Illegal instruction` although `asterisk -V` answers → the runtime was compiled for the build machine's CPU. The runtime image disables menuselect's `BUILD_NATIVE`; a rootfs built without that disable only runs on CPUs with the builder's instruction set.
- The dashboard shows `No target is connected — Asterisk: Asterisk UNKNOWN__and_probably_unsupported …` → the daemon answered and the console refused its identity. Any `Asterisk <identity>` answer now counts as running; a runtime built without a `.version` file prints that identity.
- The connection form and the wizard offer only **Local** (this machine's WSL runtime) and **SSH**: those are the two connection kinds the control plane can connect to. The design's Docker choices, and its "Manager interface" group (AMI/ARI interface, manager port, TLS, tunnel, reconnect, read-only), described a manager connection this console never makes and stored values nothing read, so they are not offered.
- Docker containers labelled `io.ding.pbx.project=ding-pbx-console` are discovered and readable through `docker exec`, but the console cannot deploy to or write into a container; only the `wsl` kind connects.

## Verification

Exercise discovery with no target, discovery with a target whose daemon is stopped, a successful `server.connect`, and a refused connection. Confirm no row is labelled connected before the control-plane response, and that a failed dashboard read retries without relaunching the app.
