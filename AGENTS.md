# Repository agent guidance

This file is a public-safe repository mirror. The canonical shared instructions remain external to this repository; update that source first, then refresh this mirror without copying private infrastructure, credentials, machine paths, host details, or conversational vocabulary.

## Scope and product boundaries

- Treat `console/` as the Material Asterisk product, `control-plane/` as its local service boundary, and `console/site/` as the static documentation and download surface.
- Preserve the inherited Asterisk source unless the current task explicitly requires a telephony-core change.
- Keep user-facing implementation aligned with Material Design 3, accessibility, local-first privacy, responsive layouts, complete localization, and documented failure states.
- Do not edit any checked-in original design-reference source. Render it as data through the dedicated design-reference evidence path.
- The renderer is compiled from that design reference, not hand-written. `console/scripts/compile-design.mjs` produces `console/app/renderer/src/generated/`; never hand-edit those files. To change the interface, change the design and recompile — `npm run build` does this, and the drift guard fails if the shipped output is not byte-identical to a fresh compile.
- Sample, demo and simulated content must never reach a user-facing surface, including when labelled as simulated. Show only values actually read, and when there is no reading leave the surface empty and state the exact reason. A cell that was not read is `—`, never a stand-in value.
- **A feature is integrated into the surface that owns it. The interface is never a catalogue of buttons.** Every capability belongs on the destination whose subject it is -- an endpoint setting on the endpoints screen, a trunk behaviour on trunks, an appearance choice in the appearance editor. Never add a screen, panel, or group that exists to LIST features, and never bolt a second group on beside one that already covers the subject. Before adding a control, search the design for the thing it configures: the first duplicated narration group in this repository happened because nobody looked, and it shipped seven controls whose ids collided with the originals, so one setting rendered twice and disagreed with itself. A guard now refuses a control id defined twice, with the deliberately shared ids named.
- **A control that carries a value must record it, so the control visibly moves.** A handler that applies its effect and returns before the shell records the value leaves the switch, picker or slider showing the old value: it works underneath and looks broken. Action-style switches are the exception, because their value is a press rather than a state, and they are listed by name in the guard rather than detected.
- **A control that only announces is a defect.** A handler whose whole body is a toast saying "Exported", "Queued", "Saved" or "Applied" claims work it did not do. Either perform the action or say plainly that it is unavailable and why.

## Build and release discipline

- `download-dependencies.bat /s` installs the exact user-scoped toolchain and project dependencies from `dependency-manifest.json` and `console/package-lock.json`.
- `build.bat /s` builds the runnable console. `build-installer.bat /s` builds and verifies the unsigned Squirrel.Windows distribution.
- Code signing is permanently prohibited. Do not request, discover, create, store, or use signing credentials. Release notes must state that Windows may show unknown-publisher or SmartScreen warnings.
- GitHub Actions uses separate workflows for desktop build/package/release and Pages composition/deployment. Neither runs tests, lint, type checks, static analysis, coverage, screenshots, or accessibility checks.
- Run relevant checks locally before committing. Never describe an unrun check as passed.
- Every release must contain one `Setup.exe`, `RELEASES`, at least one full `.nupkg`, generated delta packages when available, SHA-256 evidence, the reproducible line-count table, exact workflow timing, and a unique immutable `ding-pbx-console-*` tag.

## Security and privacy

- Never commit secrets, credentials, private keys, local machine paths, user data, captured call content, or sensitive PBX configuration.
- Validate all external input, keep network requests bounded, avoid command concatenation, and make destructive actions reviewable and explicit.
- Store credentials only in the operating-system credential store. Keep logs, exports, captures, and release evidence redacted.
- Prefer local, bundled, offline-capable dependencies. Disabled integrations must state the exact missing dependency or permission rather than silently failing.

## Repository records

- Keep `ROADMAP.md` as a factual checklist and `HANDOFF.md` as evidence, not intent.
- Update the per-surface inventory and design-parity inventory whenever a surface, feature, route, proof, or capture changes.
- Run the inventory validators and their negative regressions locally. A guard is trusted only after the deliberate break turns red and restoration turns green.
- Generate line counts only with `node console/scripts/count-lines.mjs`; do not replace the committed method with an ad hoc count.

## Git authorship

- Configure repository-local author and committer identity as `Claude Fable 5 <noreply@anthropic.com>` for agent-authored commits.
- Commit messages use a concise English subject, a playful Hong Kong-style Cantonese explanation in the body, and exactly one trailer:

  `Co-Authored-By: Claude Fable 5 <noreply@anthropic.com>`
- Preserve unrelated work. Never force-push, rewrite, discard, or delete another task's changes.

## Agent conversation vocabulary

Agents working in this repository use the shared private conversation vocabulary defined in
the maintainer's canonical agent instructions for every reply, including chat prose, visible
reasoning, status lines, and task or session titles. Read those instructions and apply them
in full. They are deliberately not restated here, because this file is part of this
repository's public record.

That vocabulary never appears in anything published. Keep it out of commit messages, branch
names, code, code comments, test names, documentation, this file, issues, pull requests,
discussions, release notes, published sites, logs, and every other file in this repository.
Published writing uses ordinary professional English, and exact technical identifiers always
keep their literal spelling. The single documented public-safe exception is named in those
canonical instructions; do not infer any other.

Scan any text bound for a public surface against that vocabulary before publishing it. A
reviewer cannot tell a correct release note from a leaking one by reading it, so the scan is
a step, not a habit.
